# DarkAnalytica

**Intelligence-grade OSINT & CTI: tools, playbooks, and reproducible analyses for defenders.**

üî¨ **Professional Cyber Threat Intelligence** | üéØ **Detection Engineering** | üß† **Structured Analytics**

DarkAnalytica provides professional-grade cyber threat intelligence (CTI) and open-source intelligence (OSINT) resources grounded in classic intelligence tradecraft. Our mission is to deliver actionable intelligence products, detection engineering capabilities, and structured analytic techniques that enable cyber defenders and analysts to make informed decisions in complex threat environments.

Built on the foundation of the Intelligence Cycle methodology, our repositories integrate MITRE ATT&CK v17.x frameworks, D3FEND defensive techniques, and intelligence community standards including estimative language, confidence assessments, and source evaluation protocols.
